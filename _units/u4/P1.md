## Warm-Up

The Create Performance Task will require you to program an app from scratch on your own. This project will be our first Practice Performance Task, which will challenge you to create an app of your own design. This time you'll have guidance.

## Exploring Examples

Let's start by exploring some expamples.

[Open Code Studio, Lesson 12 Level 2](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2020/stage/11/puzzle/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

For this project you will create an app that helps a user make a decision. Your app must take in at least one number and one string from the user that will help to make the decision. All of this information will be used as part of the decision making process. In addition, your code must include at least one function used to update the screen.

We'll be using the Code Studio App Lab but not the designated levels. This project will be a practice for the Create Peformance Task.
