## Warm-Up

For the past few days, we've learned a lot about storing and updating information in variables. Now you are going to have an opportunity to demonstrate your learning by making an app.

## Make with Variables

Now let's build the this app. The screen has been set up for you - it's your job to add the code! Make a copy of the activity guide below.

[Make a Copy of the Variables Make Activity Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lKa2xRT6Hxg1E99QKNFNIJ9-sMW_-mkh0wFygvBgrQU/edit?usp=sharing){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

Let's take a look at what the app should function like when finished. Open the link below and take a second to test the app.

[Open Code Studio, Lesson 4 Level 2](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2020/stage/4/puzzle/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

Before you submit your code on Code Studio, review the rubric on page two of the activities guide.

## Wrap-Up

Now it's time to submit your activity guide. Open the 4.A Digital Journal and attach your guide (don't forget to share it with me dbailey@k12k.com). Then answer the following prompt.
