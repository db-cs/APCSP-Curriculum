You will expand the types of apps you can create as you learn how to store information (variables), make decisions (conditionals), and better organize code (functions). Each programming topic is covered in a specific sequence of lessons that ask you to ‘Explore’ ideas through hands-on activities, ‘Investigate’ these ideas through guided code reading, ‘Practice’ with sample problems, and apply your understanding as you ‘Make’ a one-day scoped project. The entire unit concludes with a three-day open-ended project in which you must build an app that makes a recommendation about any topic you wish.

## Standards Assessed in this Unit

- **CRD-2:** Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.
- **AAP-1:** To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
- **AAP-2:** The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
- **AAP-3:** Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.

- **CP-1:** Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- **CP-2:** Develop and implement algorithms.
- **CP-3:** Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
- **CP-6:** Contributes to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.

## Key Vocabulary

- **Expression:** a combination of operators and values that evaluates to a single value
- **Assignment Operator:** allows a program to change the value represented by a variable
- **Variable:** a named reference to a value that can be used repeatedly throughout a program.
- **Boolean Value:** a data type that is either true or false.
- **Comparison Operators:** <, >, <=, >=, ==, != indicate a Boolean expression
- **Function:** a named group of programming instructions. Also referred to as a “procedure”.
- **Function Call:** a command that executes the code within a function
- **Arithmetic operator:** part of most programming languages and include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operators.
- **Boolean Expression:** evaluates to either true or false
- **Concatenation:** joins together two or more strings end-to-end to make a new string.
- **Conditional Statement:** affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression.
- **Evaluate:** Expressions are evaluated to produce a single value.
- **Expression:** a programming statement that can consist of a value, a variable, an operator, or a procedure call that returns a value.
- **Logical operator:** NOT, AND, and OR, which evaluate to a Boolean value.
- **Procedure:** a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.
- **Relational operator:** used to test the relationship between two variables, expressions, or values. A comparison using a relational operator evaluates to a Boolean value. For example: =, ≠, >, <, ≥, and ≤
- **Selection:** determines which parts of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false
- **String:** an ordered sequence of characters.
