## Warm-Up

For the past few lessons, we've learned a lot about using functions to simplify code and make it easy to edit. So far we have learned how to use functions to remove repeated code in our programs. Early on it's common to realize you need a function only after you've completely written the same chunk of code in two places. As you get better, however, you'll realize sooner and sooner in the process that you're likely going to need a function, and will be able avoid writing repeated code before putting it inside a function. Eventually you'll want to anticipate what your functions are going to be even before you start programming. These are the "during" and "before" levels we read about yesterday.

In today's Make lesson and the following project you'll have a chance to practice this. See if sometimes you can work that "during" or "before" category.

## Make Functions Activity

Let's take a look at the app you'll be building:

[Open Code Studio, Lesson 11 Level 2](https://studio.code.org/s/csp4-2020/stage/11/puzzle/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

With a partner discuss the following:

- What does this app do?
- What are the inputs?
- What are the outputs?
- How could a function be used in this app?

### Development Cycle

We need to practice following the development cycle. Before you begin working on the project let's review the process.

This time your team will not have an activity guide. Instead you'll need to go through this process on your own. Think about how previous guides led you though the process of planning and implementing code.

Now continue on to Level 3 and build your code. Use the follwing rubric after you finish to reflect and revise.
