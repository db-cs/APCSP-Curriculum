## Warm-Up

When you post information to a social network, watch a video online, or simply search for information on a search engine, some of that data is collected, and you reveal what topics are currently on your mind. When a topic is quickly growing in popularity, it is often said to be trending, but there are many different trends or patterns we might find in this data, including historical trends. These patterns might help us to identify, understand, and predict how our world is changing.

We will be using Google Trends which is a tool that allows you to visualize data about search history across different times and locations. We can use it to look for interesting patterns, trends, or relationships between multiple trends and try to tell the story that pattern is showing.

## Exploring Google Trends

When you post information to a social network, watch a video online, or simply search for information on a search engine, some of that data is collected, and you reveal what topics are currently on your mind. When a topic is quickly growing in popularity, it is often said to be trending, but there are many different trends or patterns we might find in this data, including historical trends. These patterns might help us to identify, understand, and predict how our world is changing.

We will be using Google Trends which is a tool that allows you to visualize data about search history across different times and locations. We can use it to look for interesting patterns, trends, or relationships between multiple trends and try to tell the story that pattern is showing.

### Data Stories

**Do This:**

1. With a partner, look for a "data story".
1. Try different search items and play with the drop downs to focus on a particular location or time period.
1. What interesting things do you uncover?
1. What questions can you answer with your charts?
1. Define the what (facts) and why (opinions).

### Discovering Patterns

Using Google Trends to find patterns represents an important concept in understanding how programs are used to gain insight and knowledge from data. When you worked with the tool, there were elements of both interaction and iteration. You interacted with the tool trying out several different options, and repeated the process (iteration) until you came to a possible conclusion.

As you were determining the Why in your data stories, you may have been tempted to draw concrete connections. However, it's important to remember that correlation (similarities, patterns) does not equal causation (this thing caused that thing). There can be any number of reasons why a pattern or interesting data point may appear in a chart - and our job is to make an informed decision while recognizing that there may be multiple factors at play. Usually additional research with several data sets is necessary to understand the exact nature of the relationship between data. Did this one thing cause another thing to happen? Do more people search for chocolate because they want to give it as a gift, or could there perhaps be another reason?

In this unit we will be making charts to help answer questions:

"I think this visualization tells me this…"

- Something is more popular than something else
- Something is more important than something else
- Something has become more or less searched over time

"... but I'm not sure because…"

- I don't know exactly how the data was collected
- This might tell me people searched for green more than red, but it doesn't tell me why they do that or that green is a better color
- We need more data!

When we consider datasets, it's helpful to know as much about those datasets as possible. Where did the data come from? How much data is included? When was it collected?

All of this information is considered metadata which is defined as "data about data".

### App Lab Metadata

We can have metadata about any digital data. For example, this picture contains metatdata that tells us the when the picture was created, what the resolution is, and how many people have downloaded it. Datasets can also have metadata that explains more about the information in the dataset. You've seen this in App Lab!

Now let's explore metadata in App Lab in the datasets you've used in previous units. Where can we find this information? What can it tell us about the data? How can it help us organize the data?

[Open App Lab Lesson 1 Level 2](https://studio.code.org/s/csp9-2020/lessons/1/levels/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; margin-bottom: 2em; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

**Do This:**

1. Open up Data Tab
2. Look for the metadata for a dataset

Share with a partner:

- What does this table contain?
- Where does the data come from?
- What other useful information is found in the metadata?
