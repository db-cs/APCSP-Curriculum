In this unit you will explore and visualize datasets from a wide variety of topics as you hunt for patterns and try to learn more about the world around you based on the data. Once again, you will work with datasets in App Lab, but you will now make use of a data visualizer tool that assists in finding data patterns. You will learn how different types of visualizations can be used to better understand the patterns contained in datasets and how to use visualizations when investigating hypotheses.

- **IOC-1:** While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences.

## Key Vocabulary

- **Citizen Science:** scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
- **Cleaning Data:** a process that makes the data uniform without changing its meaning (e.g., replacing all equivalent abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the same word).
- **Correlation:** a relationship between two pieces of data, typically referring to the amount that one varies in relation to the other.
- **Crowdsourcing:** the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.
- **Information:** the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data
