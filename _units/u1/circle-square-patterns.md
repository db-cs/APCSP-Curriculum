## Warm-Up

**Prompt:** How many ways can you represent 7?

Open your Week 1 Digital Journal and record your response.

## Generating Patterns

In the last lesson we ended by deciding that one of the best way to use our devices was to limit them to two options, let's say: option 1 is circles and option 2 is squares. Now let's figure out how we can use these shapes to communicate lots of different pieces of information.

**Prompt:** Work out how many different pieces of information (made of up of circles and squares) you can represent with three place values. For example: circle-circle-circle and circle-square-circle can represent two different pieces of information.

## Circle Square Activity

Open your Week 1 Digital Journal and find page 10. Work with your partners to determine the possible patterns and create rules to describe those patterns.

## Wrap-Up

**Prompt:** How is counting in this circle and square system similar to how we count in our regular lives? How is it different?

Open your Week 1 Digital Journal and record your response.
