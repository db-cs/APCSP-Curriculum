### Pre-Survey

Welcome to Computer Science Principles! This year we’re going to learn a lot about computer science, but before we begin, we want to learn a little bit about you and your thoughts on computer science in general. Let's take the [CSP Pre-Course Survey](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2020/lockable/1/puzzle/1/page/1).

## Rapid Prototypes

People seem to say that technology is all around us, that it affects everything we do. Is that true? Technological innovation is about recognizing a problem that needs to be solved, or recognizing something needs improving and then building a tool to solve it.

As a class we’re going to see how innovative we can be. We’re going to do something called “rapid prototyping.”

"Prototype" is a fancy word that means a simple sketch of an idea or model for something new. It’s the original drawing from which something real might be built or created.

Go to Canvas or check the Chat to access the Rapid Prototpe document.

## Computer Science is Everywhere

We are just starting this class, but you all bring passions and knowledge about things you care about. And whatever those things are it is likely (if not inevitable) that they involve computing technology in some way. Everyone is unique, but we’re all in this together.

**What are you excited to learn about in this course?**
