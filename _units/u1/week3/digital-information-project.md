## Warm-Up

This unit we have considered how our analog world can be represented digitally. Today we will consider the impact of digitizing our world. Does it make it better or worse?

**Prompt:** Is our world better or worse because of digital representation?

We're going to think more about this question together. You'll have a chance once we've done some more digging to update your answer if you like.

## Digital Information Dilemmas

Yesterday, you stated an opinion on a copyright issue based on reading an article. Today, you will get to choose an article to read and respond to, focusing on the digital dilemma: Is our world better or worse?

**Do This:** Choose one of the articles below. Make note of any information in this article that you want to learn more about. Afterwards, write a 10 word summary of the article.

- [The Ethics of Computer-Generated Actors - Article](https://mediaethicsinitiative.org/2019/02/13/the-ethics-of-computer-generated-actors/)
- [DNA Testing Kits & The Security Risks in Digitized DNA - Article](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dna-testing-kits-and-the-security-risks-in-digitized-dna/)
- [Athletes Don't Own Their Tattoos - Article](https://www.todayonline.com/world/athletes-dont-own-their-tattoos-thats-problem-video-game-developers)

**Prompt:** Share your 10 word summary with the group and discuss the main content in the articles. Together look up any unfamiliar words or concepts.

Now, that you have a better understanding of the content of your article, you're going to re-read the article to determine if our world is in a better or worse place.

**Project Question:** Is our world in a better or worse place because of digital representation?

**Do This:**

Re-read your article in order to answer these questions.

- What was digitized?
- What was the goal or purpose of digitizing this thing?
- Is someone benefiting from this situation? If so, who?
- Is someone being harmed in this situation? If so, who?
- Are these impacts intended or unintended? How do you know?

## Take a Stand

You need to take a stand on the project's question, using the article to help support your position. We will do this by creating an infographic. You will divide the infographic up into four sections, which will evaluate the question for this project.

**Section 1:** What is being digitized? How is the information represented digitally?

For example: Is it an image or text? Do you think it's been compressed? Which form of compression (lossy/lossless)?

**Section 2:** What is the goal or purpose of digitizing this thing?

**Section 3:** What are the benefits and harms of digitizing this content?

**Section 4:** Is our world better or worse because of digital representation? Explain why, giving examples from the article.

You may use any tool that you'd like to create your digital poster, but I'd recomend [Google Slides](https://slides.google.com), [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/), or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). You can log in using Google to any of these.

### Submitting Infographic

Once you have created your infographic, you need to submit it on Canvas. Download it as either a .jpg or .pdf and attach it on Canvas.

## Digital Dilemmas Discussion

In the last class, we started by taking a position on whether digital representaiton in making our world better or worse. Based on our discussions, how has your position changed? Where do you stand?

## Wrap-Up

There are trade-offs in representing information digitally. Usually someone is benefitting while others are harmed.

**Prompt:** Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?
