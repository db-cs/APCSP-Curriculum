You will explore the way computers store and represent complex information like numbers, text, images, and sound. The unit begins with you investigating what it means to represent information, and challenges you to design your own representation systems. You then learn the ideas behind real-world systems used to represent complex information. Later lessons focus on the challenges that arise from digitizing information, such as the need to compress it, or questions of intellectual property. The unit project emphasizes the profound impact digital information has on modern life.

Additionally, we will take time to get familiar with Canvas and the other tools we will use for the semester.

## Standards Assessed in this Unit

- **DAT1:** The way a computer represents data internally is different from the way the data is interpreted and displayed for the user. Programs are used to translate data into a representation more easily understood by people.
- **IOC1:** while computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences

## Key Vocabulary

- **Bit:** A contraction of "Binary Digit"; the single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1
- **Byte:** 8 bits
- **Overflow Error:** Error from attempting to represent a number that is too large.
- **Round-off Error:** Error from attempting to represent a number that is too precise. The value is rounded.
- **Analog Data:** Data with values that change continuously, or smoothly, over time. Some examples of analog data include music, colors of a painting, or position of a sprinter during a race.
- **Digital Data:** Data that changes discretely through a finite set of possible values
- **Sampling:** A process for creating a digital representation of analog data by measuring the analog data at regular intervals called samples.
- **Lossless Compression:** A process for reducing the number of bits needed to represent something without losing any information. This process is reversible.
- **Lossy Compression:** A process for reducing the number of bits needed to represent something in which some information is lost or thrown away. This process is not reversible.
- **Binary:** A way of representing information using only two options.
- **Creative Commons:** A collection of public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work, used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they have created
- **Data Compression:** A process for reducing the number of bits needed to represent a piece of information
- **Decimal:** a system for representing numbers using combinations of the digits 0 - 9
- **Intellectual Property:** A work or invention that is the result of creativity, such as a piece of writing or a design, to which one has rights and for which one may apply for a patent, copyright, trademark, etc.
- **Open Access:** online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
- **Open Source:** programs that are made freely available and may be redistributed and modified
