## Warm-Up

A lot of people think that computer science is the study of computers, like the phone in your pocket or the computer on your desk. As we'll see this year, computer science actually has a lot more to do with information.

**Prompt:** What is your definition of information?

Open the Week 1 Digital Jounral and record your response.

## Information Sending Devices

Today you are going to build your own device for sending and receiving messages which you will use to answer questions that you write.

- No language can be used.
  For example: You can't write the words blue and green on my device.

### Challenge #1

**Question:** Which do you like best green or blue?

**Do This:** Build a device out of available supplies to communicate the answer to your question.

### Challenge #2

**Question:** Which do you like best green, blue, red, or orange?

**Do This:** Update your device to communicate one of four possible answers to your question.

### Challenge #3

**Question:** Which do you like best green, blue, red, orange, yellow, purple, black, white?

**Do This:** Update your device to communicate one of eight possible answers to your question.

## Wrap Up

**Propmt:** Think back to your simple two-option device from Challenge #1. Instead of changing your device and adding more options every time you added more answers, how could you simply modify the way you use your device with only two options?
