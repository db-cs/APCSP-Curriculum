## Warm-Up

In your Digital Journal consider the following prompt.

**Prompt:** How many different shades of the color blue can you name? How many do you think there are in total?

## Activity

Today, we’re going to see how this relationship between analog and digital plays out in the world of color. You’re going to get a chance to play with the pixelation widget again, but this time you’ll be using it to make your own special color blends, or gradients.

### Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)

Open the [Pixelation Widget](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2020/stage/8/puzzle/3) and complete Puzzle 3.

Now complete Puzzels 5, 6, 7, 8 using the Pixelation Widget.

## Wrap-Up

So as we saw in the last two lessons, the digital versions of images we produce differ from the original analog images. Analog images change smoothly and continuously. With digital images, we are limited by the number of bits we use. Even if we use a lot of bits, we can still only represent a finite number of colors, and gradual color changes can only happen discretely through a finite set of pixels.

In your Digital Journal consider the following prompt.

**Prompt:** How is an image represented on a computer?

## Abstraction

We can see that a digital image is made up of several layers that work together to represent the analog image. This is an example of abstraction because we don’t always look at the details of what’s going on in all of these layers, but they are working behind the scenes. Let’s watch a video of how this works.
