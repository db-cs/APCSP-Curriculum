## Warm-Up

```
1 1
2 14
7 4
10 31
```

**Prompt:** Brainstorm with your partner what you think this list represents. When you think you have an idea, come up with another item to add to this list and be ready to explain why it belongs.

## Activity

In our warm-up, we used numbers to represent certain type of information. In today's activity, we will also use numbers to represent something that computers use pretty frequently: text messages.

Work with a partner to come up with a system for representing text messages using only numbers. Open your Digital Journal and record your system.

## ASCII

You just invented your own scheme for representing text with numbers. Given we use text on our phones and computers all the time, we should assume there is a standard representation for most of the symbols you can type on an American keyboard. Today we're going to be looking at one called or ASCII (pronounced: “Ask-ee”) or the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

ASCII isn't the only standard. The most commonly used on the web is UTF-8. Check out the following article to learn more about some other standards and why they were developed.

## Wrap-Up

Representing text is an example of **abstraction**, which is when we create simplified representations of something more complex. This lets us hide the details and instead focus on problems at a higher level.

Sending text messages is an example of abstraction. For a computer, each character is really just a number, which itself is really a binary number. It all comes back to zeroes and ones!

In your Digital Journal consider the following prompt.

**Prompt:** What problem were we trying to solve today? What is another example of an abstraction in your everyday life? Something where you don’t completely understand how it works but you can still use it with confidence?
