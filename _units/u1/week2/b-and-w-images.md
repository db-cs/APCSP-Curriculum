## Warm-Up

In your Digital Journal consider the following prompt.

**Prompt:** You recently did some online shopping and are expecting a package to arrive in about a month. The delivery service has a tracking system which reads the location of the package. How often would you want the location read? Every week? Every day? Every hour? Every minute? Be ready to explain your answer.

Today, we’re learning about how images are represented in computers, but let’s keep in mind these ideas about how often to take a reading or measurement.

## Intro to the Pixelation Widget

### Pixelation Widget

1. Open the [Pixelation Widget](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2020/stage/7/puzzle/3).
2. Complete Puzzles 3 and 4.

## Sampling an Analog Image

Now that you’ve had a chance to see how to set each pixel black or white, we are going to use the widget to represent an analog image using a process called sampling.

Analog is a term used to mean something with continuous representation - such as a picture you draw on a piece of paper. Each pencil line smoothly connects to the next, no matter how much you zoomed in on the picture with a magnifying glass.

When we represent an analog image digitally, we will have to make some choices on how to sample the image to get the smoothest representation possible while keeping in mind the number of bits it takes to build that image.

When we sample, we are choosing how small to make section of the picture we look at when deciding whether to make it black or white. The smaller the sample, the more pixels required to represent that image. Larger samples require less pixels, but the image can become blurry.

**Do This:**

1. Read values from Challenge A (black or white for each square) and input the values into the widget.
2. After Challenge A, answer the questions in your Digital Journal
3. Repeat for Challenge B.
4. Answer the questions in your digital journal.

## Make a Logo

**Do This:**

1. Select your favorite company logo
2. Decide how you are going to sample this logo - use one of the grids below. Draw the logo.
3. Recreate the logo in the Pixelation Widget on Level 7.
4. Show it to someone. Do they recognize the logo? Make adjustments if needed. For example: You may need to increase the sampling.

## Wrap-Up

In Challenges A and B, you and your partner practiced sampling the same image twice. The second time, we did a more frequent sampling by using smaller squares.

**Prompt** What are the pros and cons of sampling an image more frequently?
