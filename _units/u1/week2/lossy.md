## Warm-Up

## Lossy Compression

In the last activitiy we looked at an example of lossless compression. We could always reverse the process to recreate the original.

Open the [Lossy Compression Widget](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2020/stage/10/puzzle/2).

This widget is an example of lossy compression because some information gets lost, making this process not reversible. In today’s lesson, we will investigate how lossy compression works with images.

Run the program by clicking on the orange "Run" button on the app. Try to use the app. After a minute, answer the following questions:

- What do you notice about the quality of the image when you compress it?
- What do you notice about the compressed file size?

## How Much Compression

**Prompt:** Let’s imagine we are trying to use this image for a particular purpose, and we need to decide which level of compression we want to use. We will look at a series of scenarios and we will vote on how much compression is appropriate.
