Students learn to design and analyze algorithms to understand how they work and why some algorithms are considered more efficient than others. This short unit is entirely unplugged, and features hands-on activities that help students get an intuitive sense of how quickly different algorithms run and the pros and cons of different algorithms. Later in the unit, students explore concepts like undecidable problems and parallel and distributed computing.

## Standards Assessed in this Unit

- **AAP-2:** The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
- **AAP-4:** There exist problems that computers cannot solve, and even when a computer can solve a problem, it may not be able to do so in a reasonable amount of time.
- **CSN-2:** Parallel and distributed computing leverage multiple computers to more quickly solve complex problems or process large data sets.

## Key Vocabulary

- **Problem:** a general description of a task that can (or cannot) be solved with an algorithm
- **Algorithm:** a finite set of instructions that accomplish a task.
- **Efficiency:** a measure of how many steps are needed to complete an algorithm
- **Linear Search:** a search algorithm which checks each element of a list, in order, until the desired value is found or all elements in the list have been checked.
- **Binary Search:** a search algorithm that starts at the middle of a sorted set of numbers and removes half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.
- **Reasonable Time:** Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or lower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a reasonable amount of time.
- **Unreasonable Time:** Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an unreasonable amount of time.
- **Heuristic:** provides a "good enough" solution to a problem when an actual solution is impractical or impossible
- **Undecidable Problem:** a problem for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer
- **Sequential Computing:** a model in which programs run in order, one command at a time.
- **Parallel Computing:** a model in which programs are broken into small pieces, some of which are run simultaneously
- **Distributed Computing:** a model in which programs are run by multiple devices
- **Speedup:** the time used to complete a task sequentially divided by the time to complete a task in parallel
- **Decision Problem:** a problem with a yes/no answer (e.g., is there a path from A to B?)
- **Optimization Problem:** a problem with the goal of finding the "best" solution among many (e.g., what is the shortest path from A to B?)
- **Sequencing:** the application of each step of an algorithm in the order in which the code statements are given
