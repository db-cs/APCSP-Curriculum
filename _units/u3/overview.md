In this unit, you will design your first app while learning both fundamental programming concepts and collaborative software development processes. You will also work with partners to develop a simple app that teaches classmates about a topic of personal interest. Throughout the unit, you learn how to use Code.org’s programming environment, App Lab, to design user interfaces and write simple event-driven programs. Along the way, you learn practices like debugging, pair programming, and collecting and responding to feedback, which you will be able to use throughout the course as they build ever more complex projects.

## Standards Assessed in this Unit

- **CRD-1:** incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed.
- **CRD-2:** developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.
- **AAP-2:** The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
- **AAP-3:** Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.

- **CP-1:** Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- **CP-2:** Develop and implement algorithms.
- **CP-6:**	Contributes to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.

## Key Vocabulary

- **User Interface:** the inputs and outputs that allow a user to interact with a piece of software. User interfaces can include a variety of forms such as buttons, menus, images, text, and graphics.
- **Input:** data that are sent to a computer for processing by a program. Can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile interaction, audio, visuals, or text.
- **Output:** any data that are sent from a program to a device. Can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile interaction, audio, visuals, or text.
- **Program Statement:** a command or instruction. Sometimes also referred to as a code statement. 
- **Program:** a collection of program statements. Programs run (or “execute”) one command at a time.
- **Sequential Programming:** program statements run in order, from top to bottom.
- **Event Driven Programming:** some program statements run when triggered by an event, like a mouse click or a key press
- **Documentation:** a written description of how a command or piece of code works or was developed.
- **Comment:** form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people and which do not affect how a program runs. 
- **Pair Programming:** a collaborative programming style in which two programmers switch between the roles of writing code and tracking or planning high level progress
- **Debugging:** Finding and fixing problems in an algorithm or program.
- **Development process:** the steps or phases used to create a piece of software. Typical phases include investigating, designing, prototyping, and testing 
- **Event:** associated with an action and supplies input data to a program. Can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or by any other defined action that affects the flow of execution.
- **Incremental Development Process:** a design approach that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.
- **Iterative Development Process**: a design approach requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.
- **Plagiarism:** The use of material created by someone else without permission and presented as one’s own
- **Program Requirements:** descriptions how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.
- **Program specification:** a description of all the requirements for the program. 
- **Syntax Error:** a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.
- **Software:** A program or a collection of programs
