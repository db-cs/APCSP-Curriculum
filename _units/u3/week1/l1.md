## Warm-Up

Now that we've learned how to represent information digitally and how the Internet works, it's time to think about creating digital content for others to interact with.

  <p class="text-xl"><strong>ü§î Reflect:</strong> What are apps? How do we interact with them? What kinds of things do apps do?</p>
</div>

## App Exploration

Today we are going to be looking at some sample apps to explore their purpose and function. You'll be working with a partner during this activty.

[Open App Exploration on Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-2020/stage/1/puzzle/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

**Do This:** With a partner, discuss the following for each app that you explore:

- How does the user interact with the app?
- What is the overall purpose of this app?
- Who is the target audience?

### Input and Output

In developing apps, which are a kind of computing innovation, it's important to understand both their purpose and function. The purpose helps the developer focus on creating an app with specific goals in mind.

Now let's dig in to how the user interacts with the apps.

The video explained **Input**, **Storage**, **Processing**, and **Output**. Today we are going to focus on input and output. An app on a phone gets input in many different ways from a user or from another program and displays (or in the case of sound: plays) output. The output of a program is usually based on inputs or the initial way the program was set up. For example, you could program an app to play a song as soon as it runs.

**Do This:** With your partner, take another look at the sample apps you explored before by navigating to the App Investigations starting at level 7. Consider what the inputs and outputs are for the apps.

## Wrap-Up

Apps solve a problem for a target audience. Apps take in input from users and output information in various ways. Users interact with apps through the user interface.
