## Warm-Up

<div class="text-xl" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em;">
  <p><strong>ü§î Reflect:</strong> What makes a good partner?</p>
</div>

Now you've got the skills you'll need for your project, but we'll need a minute to talk about how to use them when working in teams. Today you're mostly going to have work time, but you're going to be practicing a new skill called pair programming.

## Day 1: Pair Programming

Today we're going to use the pair programming as you work on your app with your partner. To begin we'll make the partner sitting on the left the driver and the one on the right the navigator. Every few minutes I'll ask you to switch roles.

  <p><strong>‚úçÔ∏è Journal:</strong> How does Pair Programming help when working on a project? How does it help with the debugging process in particular?</p>
</div>

## Day 2: Feedback

<div class="text-xl" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em;">
  <p><strong>ü§î Reflect:</strong> Think of times when you've received helpful feedback on school work, a hobby, or a sport.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What makes good feedback?</li>
    <li>What makes bad feedback?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Today we're going to keep working on our apps, but we're also going to be getting feedback from our classmates. Let's get to it!

### Testing and Feedback

![Feedback Instructions](../../images/feedback.png)

- Group A lets Group B test their app.
- Group A watches Group B use the app, and writes down improvements that come to mind.
- Group A interviews Group B asking for specific improvements Group A can make. This may be different than what Group A came up with during the observation. These improvements are written down in the Activity Guide.
- Group A and B swap and now Group A tests Group B's app while Group B watches.

Now return to your seats and pick at least one improvement to make to their app based on feedback. Write this down in the Planning Guide in Step 7.

<div class="text-xl" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em;">
  <p><strong>‚úçÔ∏è Journal:</strong> Why is it important to get feedback from others while building your app? What is the value of getting this feedback even if you aren't finished with your app?</p>
</div>

Feedback and testing are important parts of making good software. They ensure that our apps actually work the way we designed them, and they help us make gradual improvements.

## Day 3:  Finishing Your App

Your apps are almost done and soon will be ready to share with the world. Let's get back to work. You and your partner will work on finishing your app. Don't forget to consider the suggestions your classmates made. **Check the rubric in your activity guide before submitting your app.**

## Wrap-Up

This project is designed to help us prepare for the AP Exam Create Task, which is 30% of your total AP Exam score Let's take a look at the AP Exam Create Task starting on page 6.

### Reflection

In your planning guide, there are two reflection questions. These questions are an opportunity to practice writing for the AP Exam. You will need to open the dropbox above and record your responses. While the project was completed with your partner, you must complete the reflection on your own. Just label your responses Question 1 and Question 2.

<div class="text-xl" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em;">
  <p><strong>‚úçÔ∏è Question 1:</strong> Provide a written response that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>describes the overall purpose of the program</li>
    <li>describes the functionality of your app</li>
    <li>describes the input and outputs of your app</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Approx 150 words)</p>
</div>

<div class="text-xl" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em; margin-top: 2em;">
  <p><strong>‚úçÔ∏è Question 2:</strong> This project was created using a development process that required you to incorporate the ideas of your partner and feedback from your classmates. Provide a written response that describes one part of your app that was improved through input from EITHER your partner or feedback you received from classmates. Include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Who specifically provided the idea or recommendation</li>
    <li>What their idea or recommendation was</li>
    <li>The specific change you made to your app‚Äôs user interface or functionality in response to the recommendation</li>
    <li>How you believe this change improved your app</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Approx 150 words)</p>
