## Warm-Up

<div class="text-xl" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em;">
  <p><strong>ü§î Reflect:</strong> What is a common app that you use? Take a minute to sketch the User Interface of the main screen. Note how the user interacts with the app.</p>
  
  <p>Compare your sketch with a partner and discuss common elements that both of your apps share</p>
</div>

In the previous lesson, we took a look at a few different apps and talked about input and output. We also discussed the User Interface. Today we are going to learn how to build the User Interface in App Lab.

## Design Mode

We're going start exploring the Design Mode in Code.org's App Lab.

[Open the App Lab on Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-2020/stage/2/puzzle/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

## Wrap-Up

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em;">
  <p class="text-xl"><strong>‚úçÔ∏è Journal:</strong> Based on the elements available in the App Lab answer the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What elements collect input?</li>
    <li>What elements display output?</li>
    <li>Do you think there are elements that can do both?</li>
  </ul>
</div>
