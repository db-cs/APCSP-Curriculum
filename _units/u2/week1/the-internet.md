## Warm-Up

Open your digital journal using the Dropbox above. Copy the prompt below and paste it into a reply on the journal. Record your answer below the prompt and submit your reply.

**‚úçÔ∏è Journal:** We‚Äôve learned to represent images, text, and sound digitally - but, we haven‚Äôt discussed what we do with all this digital data. How do you see people sharing this kind of data in the real world? Who do they want to share it with and why?‚Äù

So far this year, we‚Äôve investigated how to represent information digitally. Today, we‚Äôre going to investigate what it would take to communicate this information with others.

## What is the internet?

Let's take a minute to discuss what we think the internet is and the questions we have about it.

It's ok if you have a lot of questions about the Internet or aren't sure how it works. You are not alone!

## Exploring the Internet Simulator

In this unit, we are going to use a tool to understand how the Internet works, layer by layer. Just like when we talked about layers of abstraction in representing digital information, there are layers to the Internet. This tool is called the Internet Simulator. Let's check it out!

[Open the Internet Simulator](https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2020/stage/1/puzzle/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

Take five minutes to explore the tool and see what you can do with it. What are the limitations?

**ü§î Reflect:** How is the Internet Simulator similar to the Internet? How is it different?

## Wrap-Up

Why learn about how the Internet works? As Vint Cerf Says: "You can't escape from contact with the Internet. So why not get to know it?" But you don't have to take Vint Cerf's word. Some of the largest issues facing society hinge on an understanding of how the Internet functions.

At the end of this unit you will do a project focusing on a societal issues. As you go through these lessons keep you ears and eyes open for how things work.

Many of the issues are related to people taking advantage of the open protocols that make the Internet function and present us with tricky dilemmas. We will learn about protocols late in this unit.

For example there are two major issues to think about:

- **Net Neutrality** is a raging legal debate about the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.

- **Internet Censorship** is the attempt to control or suppress of what can be accessed, published, or viewed on the Internet by certain people. This can be used to protect people (i.e. to not allow access to child pornography) but can also be used to limit free speech.

To have an informed opinion though it helps to understand the technical underpinnings of how the internet works.

Finally, a major issue that our society faces is that far too few people actually understand how the Internet works! We are going to change that over the next few lessons.
