## Warm-Up

**ü§î Reflect:** In the previous lesson, we explored the Internet Simulator, where each of you were connected to one other person by a single wire. What are the potential problems with this setup?

Now we are going to build a physical representation of a computer network to address some of these very concerns!

## Building a Network

We are going to build a computer network that will let us communicate with multiple people. We will be using strings to represent our connections - if two people are connected with a string, then they are allowed to speak to each other. Only two people can be connected by a single string, but you can be connected to multiple people at the same time via multiple strings.

### Working with Your Group

I'm going to break you up into groups. Select one person from the group to copy the Human Network Google Slide and share with everyone else. They should be editors. **Be sure to add me (dbailey@k12k.com) as well, so I can access it.**.

[Open the Human Network Google Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A7tkNwEvGDL4xaXiuHp2aWhX0_6v2fYpIfYt8MUYx5s/copy){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

### Submitting

Open your Unit 2 Digital Journal. In a new reply, submit your response to the prompt below. On the toolbar, use the Google Drive to attach your groups Human Network Google Slide.

**‚úçÔ∏è Journal:** Thinking about our 3 guidelines, what is a strength of the network your group created? What is a weakness for the network your group created?

### How Data Moves on Networks

You've built some interesting networks today. Let's talk a little more about how data moves in these networks.

**Routing** is the process of finding a path from the sender to the receiver. As we have seen, there are many different paths a message might take.

How fast that message arrives is determined by **bandwidth**. In a computing network, the bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time, usually measured in bits per second. If a message arrives quickly, that may be because of high bandwidth - many bits can be sent per second. If the message arrives slowly, it could be due to low bandwidth.

## Wrap-Up

Take a look at the vocabulary words below:

- Computing Device
- Computing System
- Computing Network
- Path
- Bandwidth

**ü§î Reflect:** How would you use these words to describe today‚Äôs activity?

These are the same components that make up our modern Internet! In fact, the challenges we worked with today are the same challenges that the founders of the Internet faced. In the following lessons, we will take a closer look at how the Internet was created.

## Check For Understanding

Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.
