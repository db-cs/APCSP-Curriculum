## Inventing the Internet

Janet Abbate writes a facinating exploration of how the interent came to be. From the influences of the Cold War to the philosophical influences of college professors, the internet organically evolved and is the result of human influences. You'll be reading the introduction which provides a rapid overview of some of these influences. As you read, consider how the things we have learned over this week connect with the authors perspective.

## Reflection

After you have read the chapters, go to the dropbox above and write a mini essay (no more than 300 words) comparing what you read with what you have been learning about the way the internet works. What insights did you gain from Abbate's introduction? What influences shaped the invention of the internet?

Strong responses will be concise while addressing the topic with supporting details.

The AP exam will require you to write concisely in usually 150-200 word sections. This will be good practice writing and editing your thoughts. I'd recomend writing this in a Google Doc and then copy and pasting it into Canvas for submission.
