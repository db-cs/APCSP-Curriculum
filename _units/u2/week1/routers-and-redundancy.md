## Warm-Up

**ü§î Reflect:** In the last lesson, we saw that the Internet uses the Internet Protocol and IP Addresses to communicate across the shared Internet. How is this system similar to how we send letters in the mail? How is it different?

Today we will investigate how the Internet Protocol helps us communicate on the internet, and we will use new devices called routers to help manage how we communicate.

## Internet Simulator

Today we are using a new version of the Internet Simulator that incorporates the IP addresses we learned about yesterday. In fact, when you log onto the Internet Simulator today, you will notice that now everyone has their own IP Address, which will be important in today‚Äôs simulation.

You'll be working in groups of 3-4 for this activity.

**Do This:**

- Log into Code Studio and connect to the same router as your group number.
- Use this new version of the Internet Simulator to say hello to each person connected to your same router.

In the last lesson, everyone was directly connected to everyone else and we could see all of the messages. In today‚Äôs lesson, we‚Äôre connected to a router which helps decide which messages we receive. We can even take a look inside the router to see the decisions it is making

**Do This:**

- Open the router logs and view the messages being sent on your router.

- Now that you have seen your own messages, use the drop-down menu to view the messages across all routers. You will see all messages sent across all routers and the IP addresses of other students on other routers.

- Use the router logs to choose an IP address from each of the other routers. Send each of those people a message to ask them who they are and one of the following questions:

  - What is your favorite food?
  - What is your favorite type of animal?
  - What is your favorite color?

**Note:** Be sure to also respond to questions you get from people on other routers!

### Let's look at the logs

Let's open the router logs and view the messages across all router logs. There should now be examples of messages appearing multiple times. Find one of your own messages and see how many times it appears.

**ü§î Reflect:** Can you predict why some messages are appearing multiple times?

**Do This:**

1. Pick someone on a different router and send three separate messages with your top three favorite movies or TV shows.
2. After you send the messages, open the router logs and find these same messages in the logs. Notice how these messages traveled through the network. Did they always take the same path from your router to the other router?
3. Look at other messages that are being sent. Are there any patterns in the paths that they take?

**ü§î Reflect:** What did you notice about the messages you sent in the router logs? Did they always take the same path from your router to the other router?

## Wrap-Up

Take a look at these key vocabulary terms:

- **Router:** A type of computer that forwards data across a network

- **Redundancy:** The inclusion of extra components so that a system can continue to work even if individual components fail, for example by  having more than one path between any two connected devices in a network.

- **Fault Tolerant:** Can continue to function even in the event of individual component failures. This is important because elements of complex systems like a computer network fail at unexpected times, often in groups.



**‚úçÔ∏è Journal:** Thinking about these terms, how can we describe what we've observed in the router logs at the end of this activity? What are some practical reasons that you think messages might take different paths from one router to the other?
