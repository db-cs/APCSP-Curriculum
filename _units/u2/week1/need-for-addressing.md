## Warm-Up

**ü§î Reflect:** Imagine you were in a room with 5 other people, all with the same name as you. What might happen when you start communicating? How could you solve these problems?

Yesterday, you created a network that had strengths and weaknesses. Today, we are going to use a tool where one of the strengths is that everyone is connected and can get communications quickly at the same time. From our discussion, you might be starting to understand some of the weaknesses of this type of network.

## Scheduling

I'm going to break you up into groups. You need to make a copy of the activity guide using the link below. **Be sure to add me (dbailey@k12k.com) as well, so I can access it.**.

### Week 1

**Do This:** With your group follow the directions given in the box for Week 1

If you are a group of 5, everyone cross out Sunday
If you are a group of 4, everyone cross out Sunday and Saturday
Before starting to schedule each week, choose a random day of that week when you‚Äôre busy and cross it out

**ü§î Reflect:** With your group check that everyone's schedules match. Then discuss what worked well, what made this tricky, if there's anything you want to try differently in Week 2.

### Week 2

Let's get on the Internet Simulator and try this activity out again. This time, however, all communication is going to have to happen on the Internet Simulator.

**Do This:** Set up your board for week two in the same way as last time:

- If you're a group of 4 or 5 cross out Saturday and/or Sunday.
- Randomly cross out a day in Week 2.
- Once you're ready you can start on Week 2, but no talking is allowed at all.

**Do This:** Open the internet simulator and join a room with your group mates. Once everyone is in the room complete Week 2 on the simulator only, no talking!

**ü§î Reflect::** Fill out the table on page two of your Activity Guide. What problems did you have when communicating on the Internet Simulator this time around? What solutions did you create or would you like to try for Week 3?

### Week 3

**Do This:** Agree with your group on the set of rules you'd like to try this time around for how to communicate. Then complete Week 3 like the previous two weeks. No talking!

**Do This:** Based on your experience, take 5 minutes to write down in the rules section the collective rules you and your team would advise using going forward.

## Wrap-Up

Today we saw a lot of really important principles that are important on the Internet. The first is that if we want to talk to each other we need to know who messages are going from and to. The other is that we all are going to need to be using the same set of rules if we want to communicate with one another. Let's watch a video about these concepts.

### Submitting

Open your Unit 2 Digital Journal. In a new reply, use the Google Drive on the toolbar to attach your groups Activity Guide. Then add your response to the prompt below.

**‚úçÔ∏è Journal:** What are the similarities and differences between Internet Protocol (IP) and the addressing rules our class made? Would rules like ours or IP work if they were secret?

Today we took an important step in learning about the Internet. We saw that it's not just important to build a network connecting all these devices, but we need open and shared rules, or protocols, for how these devices will communicate. In coming lessons we'll be learning more about the protocols on the Internet.
