## 1. The Internet is Still Being Invented

![IETF Logo](../../images/ietf-logo.jpg)

The rules governing the internet is set by the Internet Engineering Task Force, and it is composed of volunteers that working in teams to set guidelines and specificiations for the various protocols that make up the internet. Anyone can join. They have no ability to enforce thier rules. Remember that protocols are agreed upon rules, so their power is the result of consensus. 

Even today the IETF's working groups are refining and designing protocols to meet the demands of an evolving internet. As more and more devices are connected, the work of this group is critical for maintaining the internet as we know it. Here's a quick topic of interest where several groups are working to develop new transport layer for the internet: [New transport technology](https://www.ietf.org/topics/transport/)

The rules of the internet are defined in documents called RFCs (Request for Comments). You can browse all the RFCs from the founding of the IETF to the present at [https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/).

## 2. The Internet is Fragile

Because the internet is the product of the democratic values of its creators, the internet tends towards values of free speech and equal access. Like most things in our world, reality does not match our ideals. The digital divide continues to widen and free speech is threatened by govermental organizations. Vint Cerf wrote the follow memo as part of an IETF RFC in 2002 shortly after the events of 9/11. He warns about the need to kee the internet free and open. The IETF does not have the authority to enforce its protocols, so the internet as we know it is fragile.
