## Warm-Up

We started this unit by writing down our thoughts on the Internet and how it works. Let's review a few of your questions on the [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/19eykKXZBDzu-KmzOlHkTAiGsSQLMViR5toBy1kMu7jQ/viewer), and see if we know the answers now.

Look how much we've learned! We may still have a few unanswered questions, and that's ok. It's good to always want to know more - and thankfully we have the Internet available to help us answer those questions!

Or at least, that's what we might think, but access to the Internet is not always guaranteed. Today we are going to start a project where you will consider a dilemma related to Internet access.

## One-Pager

Today, you are going to pretend that you are the Chief Technology Advisor for a candidate running for elected office. Your candidate is relying on you to help inform her about important technological dilemmas and come up with good policy ideas to address them. For this project youâ€™ll investigate a social dilemma related to the Internet and prepare a report summarizing your findings and making a policy recommendation for your candidate.

Let's take a look at three of the different dilemmas: Net Neutrality, Internet Censorship, and the Digital Divide.

You'll need to select one of these issues to research and make a recomendation based on your research.

The product of your project will be a one-pager, policy brief. You'll need to be concise but thoroughly defend your position. As a Cheif Technology Advisor, your job is to provide expert advice in an easlily digestible format. This will require you to synthesize research and draw conclusions to support your position.
