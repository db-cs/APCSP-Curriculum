In this unit, you will learn how the Internet works and discuss its impacts on politics, culture, and the economy. This unit heavily features the Internet Simulator, a tool designed to let you see, use, and explore the way different layers of the internet work. Through a series of activities that build on one another, you will investigate the problems the original designers of the internet had to solve and then "invent‚Äù your own solutions. At the conclusion of the unit, you will research an "Internet Dilemma," both from the standpoint of its technical background and its impacts on different groups of people.

## Standards Assessed in this Unit

- **CSN-1:** Computer systems and networks facilitate how data are transferred
- **IOC-1:** While computing innovations are typically designed to achieve a specific purpose, they may have unintended consequences

## Key Vocabulary

- **Computing Device:** a machine that can run a program, including computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors
- **Computing System:** a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose
- **Computing Network:** a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.
- **Path:** the series of connections between computing devices on a network starting with a sender and ending with a receiver.
- **Bandwidth:** the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time, usually measured in bits per second.
- **Protocol:** An agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of some system
- **IP Address:** The unique number assigned to each device on the Internet.
- **Internet Protocol (IP):** a protocol for sending data across the Internet that assigns unique numbers (IP addresses) to each connected device
- **Router:** A type of computer that forwards data across a network
- **Redundancy:** the inclusion of extra components so that a system can continue to work even if individual components fail, for example by having more than one path between any two connected devices in a network.
- **Fault Tolerant:** Can continue to function even in the event of individual component failures. This is important because elements of complex systems like a computer network fail at unexpected times, often in groups.
- **HTTP:** HyperText Transfer Protocol - the protocol used for transmitting web pages over the Internet
- **Internet:** a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocols.
- **Packet:** A chunk of data sent over a network. Larger messages are divided into packets that may arrive at the destination in order, out-of-order, or not at all.
- **Packet Metadata:** Data added to packets to help route them through the network and reassemble the original message.
- **Routing:** the process of finding a path from sender to receiver.
- **UDP:** A protocol used on the internet for fast transmission of information but with minimal error checking
- **World Wide Web:** a system of linked pages, programs, and files.
- **Router:** A type of computer that forwards data across a network
- **Certificate authority:** issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model.
- **Digital Divide:** differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics.
