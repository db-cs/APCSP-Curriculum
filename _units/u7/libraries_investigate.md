## Warm-Up

  <p class="text-xl"><strong>üßê Reflect:</strong> We are learning how to use libraries to share code with one another. Usually you do this by writing functions with parameters and return values. Why do you think it's important to use parameters and return values when writing code for other people to use?</p>

## Investigations

### State to Visit

**Level 2:** With your partner look at the project code and discuss what happens when the button is clicked. Then we'll discuss it together.

### Word Game Helper

**Level 3:** With your partner investigate Run this program and read the code carefully with a partner. Try several different inputs. Then test the functions using `console.log`.

## Wrap-Up

In Lesson 2, we learned about Procedural Abstraction, where shared features of functions (also known as procedures) are extracted in order to generalize use. Procedural Abstraction encourages code reuse and manages complexity, because generalized functions can be used to accomplish many different tasks.

Now let's extend that definition. Procedural Abstraction provides a **name for a process** and **allows the procedure to be used only knowing what it does**, and not necessarily how it does it.

This is how our libraries work!

There's a term for using libraries or other forms of organization in a program: **Modularity** - the subdivision of a computer program into separate subprograms. This is what we are doing when we organize functions into a library and then call them in another program.

The end user of the library only needs to know how the functions work, which they can learn through the documentation. This means that the creator of the library can update the functions for any number of reasons, such as making the functions more efficient, without having to notify the end users, as long as the function documentation does not need to be changed. The end users can expect the library to work as intended.

Before you submit, review the rubric on the Activity Guide. Make sure you have completed all of the tasks.

  <ul>
    <li>Libraries help programmers collaborate because...</li>
