You will learn how to design clean and reusable code that can be shared with a single classmate or the entire world. In the beginning of the unit, you are introduced to the concepts of parameters and return, which allow you to design functions that implement an algorithm. In the second half of the unit, you learn how to design libraries of functions that can be packaged up and shared with others. The unit concludes with you designing their own small library of functions that can be used by a classmate.

## Standards Assessed in this Unit

- **CRD-2:** Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.
- **AAP-2:** The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
- **AAP-3:** Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.

## Key Vocabulary

- **Parameter:** a variable in a function definition. Used as a placeholder for values that will be passed through the function.
- **Argument:** the value passed to the parameter
- **Return:** used to return the flow of control to the point where the procedure (also known as a function) was called and to return the value of expression.
- **Procedural abstraction:** Extracting shared features to generalize functionality
- **Library:** a group of functions (procedures) that may be used in creating new programs
- **API:** Application Program Interface - specifications for how functions in a library behave and can be used
- **Modularity:** The subdivision of a computer program into separate subprograms
- **Procedural Abstraction:** a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does, not how it does it. Procedural abstraction allows a solution to a large problem to be based on the solution of smaller subproblems. This is accomplished by creating procedures to solve each of the subproblems.
