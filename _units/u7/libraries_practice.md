When we program with libraries we can use functions that take care of difficult or repetitive tasks. Instead of focusing on these details we can focus on the big picture of what it is that we want our programs to do and just assume that those details are handled by library functions. As we'll see in today's lesson that leads to two important realizations.

- Our programs may often be shorter and easier to read
- We need to debug libraries carefully before we share them to make sure they really work

## Libraries Practice

You're mostly going to practice what we've learned about programming with libraries. In general we want to use the debugging process we've practiced all year, but here's some specific things to look out for in today's lesson.

- Test library code using console.log. Call the function with many different values to make sure it works as you expect
- It's much harder for someone to debug library code once it's sent to them. You'll need to make sure it works on your end.

You'll work with a partner to complete the following levels on Code.org:
