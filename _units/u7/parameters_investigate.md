## Warm-Up

  <p class="text-xl"><strong>üßê Reflect:</strong> Are clean and organized programs more useful for computers or people? Why? Try to give examples from programs you've written or seen in this class.</p>
</div>

Clean programs may sometimes run "better" but usually they're just helpful for us as we read them and write them. In other words, clean code is for people, but in the long run writing good code can help us write larger and more complicated programs because we can just read them and understand what they're doing.

Today we're going to learn more about parameters and return values. Something important to notice is that they might not actually change the way that your programs run, but they definitely will change the way we read and write programs. In general they'll make programs cleaner and easier to understand, but let's go look at some examples.

## Investigations

### Number Cruncher

**Level 2:** With your partner investigate the number cruncher app. Then we'll discuss together. If you have time, work on the modificiations.
