Today we're going to be working on another Make project, but this one is a little bit different than others we've done in the course. A lot of the code will already be written for us, and we'll be working on blank functions, rather than entirely blank programs. Thanks to the way that parameters and return work, it's easy to design programs this way.

## Build the Rock Paper Scissors App

First let's explore the app you will be building. With a partner explore and consider the following questions:

- What does each button do
- How does the screen get updated after clicking each button

[Lesson 4 Level 2](https://studio.code.org/s/csp7-2020/stage/4/puzzle/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

Now let's build the this app. This Make project is a little different than other ones. Instead of writing all of the code yourself, most of it has already been written for you. There are just three functions at the bottom that have been designed and have comments explaining how they should work but the code for each function is incomplete or only works for some inputs. Read the comments for these three functions carefully. You can also quickly read the rest of the program if you like.

Remember to follow the process. It is important to practice this as we get closer to the AP Create Task. Consider how you'd use these concepts to help build your create task.

## Wrap-Up

Before you submit, review the rubric on the Activity Guide. Make sure you have completed all of the tasks.

  <p>Attach your Activity Guide using the Google Drive icon in the toolbar. Ask if you need help finding it.</p>
</div>

Parameters and return help us chunk programs into pieces. Each important piece can be made into its own function which can be written and tested separately from the others. If you and your partner agree in advance how to split up the way a program is written and are clear on what each function needs to do, you could develop a program just like this make project.
