## Warm-Up

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em; margin: 2em 0 0 0;">
  <p class="text-xl"><strong>üßê Reflect:</strong> Think back over all the different apps you've built this semester. What blocks do you wish already came with App Lab to help you build those apps?</p>
</div>

Today we're going to begin our final project before the Create PT. You'll be building a library of functions that you and others will be able to import and use. You'll get to customize App Lab.

## Make a Library

- [Make a Copy of the Activity Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWYIcdq-D-itF2SOuhUF312xJjcZqLSQRytrKhMZj0E/copy){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

Be sure you follow the guide as you develop your library. Check out the following design thinking process. How is it similar to the process we have previously used? What is different?

### Where to Build

We'll use the lesson 9 levels to build and test our libraries. Make sure you spend some time testing on your own before you send your library to someone else for feedback.

[Test a Classmates Library on Lesson 9 Level 3](https://studio.code.org/s/csp7-2020/stage/9/puzzle/3){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; margin-bottom: 2em; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

## Wrap-Up

When you have completed your library and recieved feedback you'll need to complete the Free Response questions in the activity guide. These are SUPER IMPORTANT because they are exactly like the questions you'll see on the AP Create Task for procedural abstraction. Make sure you spend enough time on these, so you are familiar with what you'll need to do for the AP task.

Once you have completed the responses, check the rubric at the end of the activity guide. Did you complete everything? Now turn your project in on Canvas. Be sure to attach your activity guide and that you have put the URL for your library at the top of the guide. This will help me when I'm checking things.
