## Warm-Up

Today we're going to have a chance to practice programming with a lot of the concepts and patterns we've explored over the last two lessons. I encourage you to go through these with a partner, but pay close attention to what each other is doing. In our next lesson you're going to have to use a lot of these on an independent project, and these activities are good practice for what you'll find there! Alright, let's get to it!

## Lists Practice

You'll work with a partner to complete the following levels on Code.org:

- [Levels 2-3 Setting Up Lists](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2020/stage/3/puzzle/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}
- [Levels 4-6 Accessing Elements in a List](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2020/stage/3/puzzle/4){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}
- [Levels 7 Strings and Indexes](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2020/stage/3/puzzle/7){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}
- [Levels 9-12 List Operations](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2020/stage/3/puzzle/9){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

## Wrap-Up

Working with lists can be tricky - especially working with the index. We will get more practice tomorrow by making an app that uses lists to store information.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em; margin: 2em 0 0 0;">
