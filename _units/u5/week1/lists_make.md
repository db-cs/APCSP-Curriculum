## Warm-Up

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em;">
  <p class="text-xl"><strong>ü§î Reflect:</strong> Imagine you want to build an app for reminders. What information do you think would be stored in a list?</p>
</div>

For the past few days, we've learned a lot about using lists to help apps keep track of information. In today's Make Project you'll be practicing using lists and programming patterns with lists to create a functioning Reminders app.

### Explore the Example

With a partner explore the working app and consider the following questions:

- How many lists do you think are needed to make this app work?
- What programming patterns with lists do you think you'll need to use?

## Practice Make

Now let's build the this app. The screen has been set up for you - it's your job to add the code! Make a copy of the activity guide below and share it with your partner and me (dbailey@k12k.com).

Once you have a plan, open Code studio and implement your plan.

## Wrap-Up

Before you submit, review the rubric on the Activity Guide. Make sure you have completed all of the tasks.
