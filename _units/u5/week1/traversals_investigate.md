### Mile Tracker

[Code Studio, Lesson 10 Level 2](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2020/stage/10/puzzle/2){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

**Level 2:** Read the entire code, and then focus your attention on a single function. You should re-read the code for your function.

- Student A - average() (lines 32-38)
- Student B - slow() (lines 40-48)
- Student C - fast() (lines 50-58)
- Student D - numberedListDisplay() (lines 60-66)

**Discuss:** In your group, discuss how each of your functions work, specifically referencing the list it uses and how it is traversed using a for loop.

**Modify:** Work with a partner to create a function that adds together the total time of every element in the list. Console.log the result. Call this function in the updateScreen() function.

## Data Tab Investigate

[Code Studio, Lesson 10 Level 3](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2020/stage/10/puzzle/3){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

**Level 3 (5 mins):** Read the code, and then investigate the data tab.

**Modify:** Choose a new dataset to import to the project. Then modify the code to print out a column of data from the chosen dataset. Notice when you pull out a column from the dataset, you are creating a list.

## Random Dog Picker

[Code Studio, Lesson 10 Level 4](https://studio.code.org/s/csp5-2020/stage/10/puzzle/4){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

**Level 4:** Run the app and then carefully read it. There is a lot of information in the comments in this app. Work through all of the questions on the screen.

**Discuss:** Go through the questions one by one and answer them with your parnter.

## Patterns

**Levels 5-6:** Let's review the patterns in these levels as a class.

## Wrap-Up

Before you submit, review the rubric on the Activity Guide. Make sure you have completed all of the tasks.

  <p class="text-xl"><strong>✍️ Journal:</strong></p>
  <p>A) What aspects of using traversals to process a list do you feel you already understand? What questions do you want to dig into more tomorrow during the practice lesson? Use vocabulary as you reflect.</p>
  <p>B) Explain how you would filter the dog dataset using traversal to have a filtered list of dogs who live long lives.</p>
