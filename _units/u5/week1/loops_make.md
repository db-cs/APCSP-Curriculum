## Warm-Up

For the past few days, we've learned a lot about using lists to help apps keep track of information. In today's Make Project you'll be practicing using lists and programming patterns with loops to create a functioning Lock Screen app.

### Explore the Lock Screen Maker App

With a partner explore the working app and consider the following questions:

- Where (if at all) do you think this app is using a loop?
- Where (if at all) do you think this app is using a list?

## Explore the Lock Screen Maker App

Now let's build the this app. The screen has been set up for you - it's your job to add the code! Make a copy of the activity guide below and share it with your partner and me (dbailey@k12k.com).

Once you have a plan, open Code studio and implement your plan.

## Wrap-Up

Before you submit, review the rubric on the Activity Guide. Make sure you have completed all of the tasks.
