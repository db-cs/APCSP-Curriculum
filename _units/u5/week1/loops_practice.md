## Warm-Up

Today we're going to have a chance to practice programming with a lot of the concepts and patterns we've explored over the last two lessons. I encourage you to go through these with a partner, but pay close attention to what each other is doing. In our next lesson you're going to have to use a lot of these on an independent project, and these activities are good practice for what you'll find there! Alright, let's get to it!

## Lists Practice

Today you're mostly going to practice what we've learned about programming with loops. I'm here to help you when you need. However, I first want to remind you of the following:

- Use your debugging skills. Try to zoom in on precisely where you're getting stuck.
- Talk to your partner! That's what they're there for!
- Hover over blocks to read the documentation about how they work.
- Read the resources in the Help & Tips tab
- Talk to the group next to you. If another group asks for help make sure to take some time to talk it through with them.

You'll work with a partner to complete the following levels on Code.org:

## Wrap-Up

Working with loops can be tricky - especially working with the iterator variable. We will get more practice next by making an app that uses loops in an interesting way.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em; margin: 2em 0 0 0;">

When you get finished, open up the two practice questions below to see how you might encounter Loops on the multiple-choice part of the exam.
