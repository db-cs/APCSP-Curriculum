## Warm-Up

Today we're going to have a chance to practice programming with a lot of the concepts and patterns we've explored over the last two lessons. I encourage you to go through these with a partner, but pay close attention to what each other is doing. In our next lesson you're going to have to use a lot of these on an independent project, and these activities are good practice for what you'll find there! Alright, let's get to it!

## Lists Practice

Today you're mostly going to practice what we've learned about programming with traversals. I'm here to help you when you need. However, I first want to remind you of the following:

- Use your debugging skills. Try to zoom in on precisely where you're getting stuck.
- Talk to your partner! That's what they're there for!
- Hover over blocks to read the documentation about how they work.
- Read the resources in the Help & Tips tab
- Talk to the group next to you. If another group asks for help make sure to take some time to talk it through with them.

We can debug traversals by using many skills that helped us with lists like using the watch panel and console.log. Another important new debugging skill will be to actually **go look at your data in the Data tab**. Use console.log to make sure you're successfully getting the data you want.

You'll work with a partner to complete the following levels on Code.org:

## Wrap-Up

Working with traversals can be tricky. We will get more practice next by making an app that uses traversals and the data tools. When you get finished, open up the practice question below to see how you might encounter Loops on the multiple-choice part of the exam.
