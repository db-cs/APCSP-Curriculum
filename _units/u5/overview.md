You will learn to build apps that use and process lists of information. Like the previous unit, you will learn the core concepts of lists, loops, and traversals through a series of EIPM lesson sequences. Later in the unit, you will explore to tools that allow you to import tables of real-world data to help further power the types of apps they can make. At the conclusion of the unit, you will complete a three day project in which you must design an app around a goal of your choosing that uses one of these data sets.

## Standards Assessed in this Unit

- **CRD-2:** Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.
- **AAP-1:** To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
- **AAP-2:** The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
- **AAP-3:** Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.

- **CP-1:** Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- **CP-2:** Develop and implement algorithms.
- **CP-3:** Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
- **CP-6:** Contributes to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.

## Key Vocabulary

- **List:** an ordered collection of elements
- **Element:** an individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index
- **Index:** a common method for referencing the elements in a list or string using numbers
- **Iteration:** a repetitive portion of an algorithm which repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met.
- **Infinite loop:** occurs when the ending condition will never evaluate to true.
- **Traversal:** the process of accessing each item in a list one at a time
- **Append:** add elements to the end of a list
- **Data abstraction:** manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of the representation.
- **Loops (iteration statements):** change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met
- **Logic Error:** a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.
- **Simulation:** abstractions of more complex objects or phenomena for a specific purpose.
- **Substring:** part of an existing string
