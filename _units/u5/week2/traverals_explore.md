title: 5.A Traversals Explore
unit: Lists, Loops, and Traversals
order: 9
is_assignment: true
objectives:
  - Use appropriate vocabulary to describe traversals.
  - Understand how to use a loop to traverse a list
  - Trace simple programs with loop traversals
---

## Warm-Up

Let's review key vocabulary for lists and loops:

- **List** - an ordered sequence of elements.
- **Element** - an individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index.
- **Index** - a common method for referencing the elements in a list or string using natural numbers.
- **Iteration** - a repetitive portion of an algorithm. Iteration repeats until a given condition is met.

## Exploring Loops Activity

You'll be working with a partner and you should have the following items:

- Stickies
- Baggies
- Scissors
- Pen/Pencil
- Traversal Machine

## Wrap-Up

We can use traversals to modify data in several different ways that we will investigate next, including transforming or changing each element in a list, filtering a dataset, and combining or comparing data.
