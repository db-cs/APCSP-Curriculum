## Warm-Up

The Create Performance Task will require you to program an app from scratch on your own. This project will be our first Practice Performance Task, which will challenge you to create an app of your own design. This time you'll have guidance.

## Hackathon

Today we are beginning the Hackathon Project, which is an opportunity for you to show off what you've learned so far.

What is a hackathon? Traditionally, hackathons are events where people come together to build something creative in a short amount of time. Sometimes hackathons are centered around a goal or a problem to solve. Usually team members take on different roles (programming, designing, etc.) to get the project done within the time limit.

## Exploring Samples

We'll take a look at two samples first.

### Level 2 Sample

[Example 1 App](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/hGGs32BtXJMHnxpglngOa3XWPYHzy1obVNG9GYrgU5I){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}
[Example 1 Activity Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k4Gy9UlB7jNfDwq-zFxyODi5fgNTaom1uuTE7HgpFv8/preview){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}
[Example 1 Written Responses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CnpIoCRDR511Poisw9AWBs2_MZjYS4fKJGiqV_mIdss/preview){: style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 8px 10px; background: #efefef;" target="\_blank"}

### Now It's Your Turn

You will work with a partner on the Hackathon Project, using a database to create an interesting app.

We'll have two roles:

- **Programmer:** Responsible for the majority of the programming. Needs to communicate decisions with the designer.
- **Designer:** Responsible for the design of the app. Pair programs with the programmer as needed.

We'll be using the Code Studio App Lab - **not the designated levels**. This project will be a practice for the Create Peformance Task.

## Wrap-Up

Before you submit, please review the rubric and make revisions. In the dropbox, you should include a link to your project (hit the share button on the top left and copy the URL) and your responses to the following prompts. Additionally, you will turn in your paper copy of the planning guide.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em; margin: 2em 0 0 0;">
  <p class="text-xl"><strong>Question 1:</strong>  Provide a written response that describes the overall purpose of the program.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>describes the overall purpose of the program </li>
    <li>describes the functionality of your app</li>
    <li>describes the input and outputs of your app</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Approx 150 words)</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px; padding: 0.5em 2em 1em 2em; margin: 2em 0 0 0;">
  <p class="text-xl"><strong>Question 2:</strong> Insert screenshots of two program code segments that contain a list being used in your program.</p> 
  <p>The first program code segment should show how the data has been stored in the list.</p>
  <p>The second program code segment should show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple items in the list. </p>
  <p>Write a written response that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identifies the name of the list being processed.</li>
    <li>Identifies what the data contained in the list is representing in your program.</li>
    <li>Explains how the list manages complexity in your program by explaining how your program code would be written differently if you did not use the list.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Approx 150 words)</p>
