## Warm-Up

For the past few days, we've learned a lot about using traversals to make apps that manipulate large amounts of information. In today's Make Project you'll be practicing processing lists and using programming patterns with traversals to create a functioning Random Forecaster app.

## Build the Random Forecaster App

First let's explore the app you will be building. With a partner explore and consider the following questions:

- What information is needed to create this app?
- What list filtering patterns might be used?

Now let's build the this app. The screen has been set up for you - it's your job to add the code!

Remember to follow the process. It is important to practice this as we get closer to the AP Create Task.

## Wrap-Up

Before you submit, review the rubric on the Activity Guide. Make sure you have completed all of the tasks.
