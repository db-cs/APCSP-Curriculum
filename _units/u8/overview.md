This short unit prepares you to complete the APÂ® Create Performance Task (PT). You have learned the skills and concepts necessary to complete the task in previous units and have even have seen components of the task itself. This unit fully explains all components of the task and walks you through completing and submitting it.

For the next ~12-16 days, you will be completing the Create Performance Task. Most of the work for this task must be done independently - but you are allowed to collaborate with another student to create a program. However, you must have enough individual contributions to meet all the requirements of the written responses. I (teacher) can help you with process and timeline and keep you on task. There are a few other last minute things we should look at to make sure you're clear before we start.

## Standards Assessed in this Unit

- **AAP1** - To find specific solutions to generalizable problems, programmers represent and organize data in multiple ways.
- **AAP2** - The way statements are sequenced and combined in a program determines the computed result. Programs incorporate iteration and selection constructs to represent repetition and make decisions to handle varied input values.
- **AAP3** - Programmers break down problems into smaller and more manageable pieces. By creating procedures and leveraging parameters, programmers generalize processes that can be reused. Procedures allow programmers to draw upon existing code that has already been tested, allowing them to write programs more quickly and with more confidence.
- **CP-1** - Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- **CP-2** - Develop and implement algorithms.
- **CP-3** - Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
- **CP-4** - Evaluate and test algorithms and programs.
