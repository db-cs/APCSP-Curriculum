| `9`  | Data Explore and visualize datasets from a wide variety of topics as you hunt for patterns and try to learn more about the world around you.                         |
| `10` | Cybersecurity and Global Impacts Research and debate current events at the intersection of data, public policy, law, ethics, and societal impact.                    |

### AP CSP Conceptual Framework

The CS Principles Conceptual Framework developed by the College Board outlines five “Big Ideas” of computing which are further subdivided into Enduring Understanding, Learning Objectives, and Essential Knowledge Statements. The framework further identifies six “Computational Thinking Practices,” containing skills that students should employ and develop. The curriculum is designed such that students investigate each of these big ideas while practicing computational thinking practices.

| Big Ideas Computational              | Thinking Practices                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Creative Development (CRD)           | Computational Solution Design (CTP1)      |
| Data (DAT)                           | Algorithms and Program Development (CPT2) |
| Algorithms and Programming (AAP)     | Abstraction in Program Development (CPT3) |
| Computing Systems and Networks (CSN) | Code Analysis (CPT4)                      |
| Impact of Computing (IOC)            | Computing Innovations (CPT5)              |
|                                      | Responsible Computing (CPT6)              |

#### Rating Scale

Our course will use Standards-Based Grading for reporting. Since the AP exam is scored on a scale of 1-5, we will use the same rating system. Your assessments will be scored using the following scale.

| Rating | Meaning                  | Traditional Grade Equivalent\* |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 5      | Extremely well qualified | A+ or A                        |
| 4      | Very well qualified      | A-, B+, or B                   |
| 3      | Qualified                | B-, C+, or C                   |
| 2      | Possibly qualified       | D                              |
| 1      | No recommendation        | F                              |

**NOTE:** The Traditional Grade Equivalents vary, so I will be using a preponderance of evidence to determine those for each reporting period. Your ratings should give you a ballpark idea of where you stand.

### Explore Curricular Requirement

The College Board requires that students explore Computing Innovations (CI) a minimum of three times, and address the following prompts at least once:

1. Explain the beneficial and harmful effects of at least one computing innovation on society, economy, or culture.
1. Identify the data used in at least one computing innovation and explain how the data is consumed, produced, or transformed by the given computing innovation.
1. Identify data privacy, security, or storage concerns for at least one computing innovation.

Students complete the Explore Curricular Requirements in Unit 10: Cybersecurity and Global Impacts, during the Innovation Simulation project where they act as delegates proposing innovations to improve a “future school.”

- Students research and discuss three different computing innovations and consider the data that is being collected along with the function and purpose of the innovations (CI 1, Prompt B).
- Students choose one computing innovation to develop into a one-page proposal. Included in this proposal are the purpose and benefits of the computing innovation, its function, the data collected, and potential concerns along with how those concerns could be addressed (CI 2, Prompts A, B, and C).
- Students work with their groups to create a presentation about their computing innovations with the goal of convincing others that their innovations together are the best to address the concerns of the “future school.” Students discuss their innovations with their group to create a unifying theme for their presentation. Before the presentations are delivered, groups meet together to learn about each other’s innovations and give feedback on presentations. At this point in the project, students will have explored and discussed all the innovations in their own group along with the top innovations from another group (CI 3, Prompts A, B, and C).
